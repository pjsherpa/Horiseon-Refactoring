Definition:
Refactoring: In refactoring an exisiting code is reorganized and restructured internally but it's external behavior is not changed.

HTML CSS Git Challenge: Mention's Code Refactor
challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.
Basically, web accessibility means that website, tools and technoligies are accessible to persons with disabilities. More specifically people are able to perceive, understand, navigate, interact and contribute to the web assistive technology.
One of the Color combinations to avoid for people with color blindness include: Blue and Gray. 

Note to Marketing Agency:
Picking Blue and Gray colors for this webpage can lead an issue for accessibility for color blind people. To take in mind as Refactoring relates to only restructuring of internal structure and not external behaviors. No changes on the colors for this.
